## Formulas Used in the Analysis

### 1. Home Size Category Formula  
Classifies homes based on the area in square feet into categories: Compact, Standard, Spacious, and Luxury.

`=IF(Area <= 5000, "Compact", IF(Area <= 8000, "Standard", IF(Area <= 11000, "Spacious", "Luxury")))`

---

### 2. Parking Availability Classification  
Classifies parking availability into four tiers: No Parking, Limited, Moderate, Spacious.


---

### 3. Pricing Status Formula  
Identifies overpriced homes based on various features, including price per square foot, amenities, and location.

`=IF(AND([@[Price per sqft]] > 993, [@area] < 5000, 
    OR([@guestroom]="no", [@mainroad]="no", [@basement]="no", 
       [@hotwaterheating]="no", [@[preffered area]]="no", 
       [@airconditioning]="no", [@furnishingstatus]="unfurnished")),
  "Overpriced", "Normal")`
  
## 7. Analytical Approach  
Using descriptive and diagnostic analysis techniques:

- Compared average prices across number of bedrooms, floors, and furnishing types  
- Measured the impact of features like heating, air conditioning, and parking  
- Segmented homes by *Pricing Status* and *Home Size*  
- Built 2 interactive dashboards to explore patterns and surface insights  

---

## 8. Key Insights  

### Room Counts  
- **4-bedroom homes** had the highest prices  
- Additional bedrooms beyond 4 did not increase value  
- Each additional bathroom adds value  
- Prices increase with number of floors but taper off after 3 floors  

### Compact Homes  
- Highest *Price per Sqft* at **$1,095**  
- Most prone to being **overpriced**  

### Amenities  
- Homes with **hot water heating** and **air conditioning** had significantly higher prices  
- Only **5%** of homes had hot water heating  
- **Fully furnished** homes average **$5.5M** — significantly more than unfurnished homes  
- **68%** of homes were fairly priced; **32%** were overpriced  

### Parking & Location  
- Price increases with available parking  
- Preferred locations command premium prices  

---

## 9. Stakeholder-Specific Recommendations  

### For Property Sellers  
- **Invest in Key Features**: Install hot water heating and air conditioning to boost value  
- **Avoid Overpricing Small Homes**: Especially compact homes priced above $993/sqft  

### For Buyers  
- **Watch for Red Flags**: Be cautious of small, feature-poor homes at high price per sqft  
- **Negotiate Smartly**: Use these insights to justify price reductions  

### For Developers  
- **Build Spacious, Feature-Rich Homes**: Better pricing fairness and buyer appeal  
- **Close the Feature Gap**: Capitalize on the unmet demand for premium amenities  

### For Real Estate Agents  
- **Use Pricing Logic to Guide Valuation**
